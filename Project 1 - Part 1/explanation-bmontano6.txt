VSFTPD is an FTP server ran on Linux. In July of 2011, a mistakenly-uploaded version (v2.3.4) of VSFTPD hit the web with a backdoor vulnerability that allowed a user to enter a ":)" smiley face as the username. Upon entering the smiley face, a shell is established via a TCP callback. I was able to confirm this by, once I had been successful in achieving a shell, I ran:

lsof -i :6200

and the coressponding output:

sh      4828 root    0u  IPv4  12686       TCP 12.0.0.2:6200->12.0.0.3:46139 (ESTABLISHED)
sh      4828 root    1u  IPv4  12686       TCP 12.0.0.2:6200->12.0.0.3:46139 (ESTABLISHED)
sh      4828 root    2u  IPv4  12686       TCP 12.0.0.2:6200->12.0.0.3:46139 (ESTABLISHED)

A shell had clearly been established on port 6200.
